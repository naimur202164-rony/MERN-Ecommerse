## 1.5.1

 - Q.any now annotates its error message to clarify that Q.any was involved and
   includes only the last error emitted. (Ivan Etchart)
 - Avoid domain.dispose during tests in preparation for Node.js 9. (Anna
   Henningsen)

## 1.5.0

 - Q.any gives an error message from the last rejected promise
 - Throw if callback supplied to "finally" is invalid (@grahamrhay)
 - Long stack trace improvements, can now construct long stack traces
   across rethrows.

## 1.4.1

 - Address an issue that prevented Q from being used as a `<script>` for
   Firefox add-ons. Q can now be used in any environment that provides `window`
   or `self` globals, favoring `window` since add-ons have an an immutable
   `self` that is distinct from `window`.

## 1.4.0

 - Add `noConflict` support for use in `<script>` (@jahnjw).

## 1.3.0

 - Add tracking for unhandled and handled rejections in Node.js (@benjamingr).

## 1.2.1

 - Fix Node.js environment detection for modern Browserify (@kahnjw).

## 1.2.0

 - Added Q.any(promisesArray) method (@vergara).
   Returns a promise fulfilled with the value of the first resolved promise in
   promisesArray. If all promises in promisesArray are rejected, it returns
   a rejected promise.

## 1.1.2

 - Removed extraneous files from the npm package by using the "files"
   whitelist in package.json instead of the .npmignore blacklist.
   (@anton-rudeshko)

## 1.1.1

 - Fix a pair of regressions in bootstrapping, one which precluded
   WebWorker support, and another that precluded support in
   ``<script>`` usage outright. #607

## 1.1.0

 - Adds support for enabling long stack traces in node.js by setting
   environment variable `Q_DEBUG=1`.
 - Introduces the `tap` method to promises, which will see a value
   pass through without alteration.
 - Use instanceof to recognize own promise instances as opposed to
   thenables.
 - Construct timeout errors with `code === ETIMEDOUT` (Kornel Lesiński)
 - More descriminant CommonJS module environment detection.
 - Dropped continuous integration for Node.js 0.6 and 0.8 because of
   changes to npm that preclude the use of new `^` version predicate
   operator in any transitive dependency.
 - Users can now override `Q.nextTick`.

## 1.0.1

 - Adds support for `Q.Promise`, which implements common usage of the
   ES6 `Promise` constructor and its methods. `Promise` does not have
   a valid promise constructor and a proper implementation awaits
   version 2 of Q.
 - Removes the console stopgap for a promise inspector. This no longer
   works with any degree of reliability.
 - Fixes support for content security policies that forbid eval. Now
   using the `StopIteration` global to distinguish SpiderMonkey
   generators from ES6 generators, assuming that they will never
   coexist.

## 1.0.0

:cake: This is all but a re-release of version 0.9, which has settled
into a gentle maintenance mode and rightly deserves an official 1.0.
An ambitious 2.0 release is already around the corner, but 0.9/1.0
have been distributed far and wide and demand long term support.

 - Q will now attempt to post a debug message in browsers regardless
   of whether window.Touch is defined. Chrome at least now has this
   property regardless of whether touch is supported by the underlying
   hardware.
 - Remove deprecation warning from `promise.valueOf`. The function is
   called by the browser in various ways so there is no way to
   distinguish usage that should be migrated from usage that cannot be
   altered.

## 0.9.7

 - :warning: `q.min.js` is no longer checked-in.  It is however still
   created by Grunt and NPM.
 - Fixes a bug that inhibited `Q.async` with implementations of the new
   ES6 generators.
 - Fixes a bug with `nextTick` affecting Safari 6.0.5 the first time a
   page loads when an `iframe` is involved.
 - Introduces `passByCopy`, `join`, and `race`.
 - Shows stack traces or error messages on the console, instead of
   `Error` objects.
 - Elimintates wrapper methods for improved performance.
 - `Q.all` now propagates progress notifications of the form you might
   expect of ES6 iterations, `{value, index}` where the `value` is the
   progress notification from the promise at `index`.

## 0.9.6

 - Fixes a bug in recognizing the difference between compatible Q
   promises, and Q promises from before the implementation of "inspect".
   The latter are now coerced.
 - Fixes an infinite asynchronous coercion cycle introduced by former
   solution, in two independently sufficient ways.  1.) All promises
   returned by makePromise now implement "inspect", albeit a default
   that reports that the promise has an "unknown" state.  2.) The
   implementation of "then/when" is now in "then" instead of "when", so
   that the responsibility to "coerce" the given promise rests solely in
   the "when" method and the "then" method may assume that "this" is a
   promise of the right type.
 - Refactors `nextTick` to use an unrolled microtask within Q regardless
   of how new ticks a requested. #316 @rkatic

## 0.9.5

 - Introduces `inspect` for getting the state of a promise as
   `{state: "fulfilled" | "rejected" | "pending", value | reason}`.
 - Introduces `allSettled` which produces an array of promises states
   for the input promises once they have all "settled".  This is in
   accordance with a discussion on Promises/A+ that "settled" refers to
   a promise that is "fulfilled" or "rejected".  "resolved" refers to a
   deferred promise that has been "resolved" to another promise,
   "sealing its fate" to the fate of the successor promise.
 - Long stack traces are now off by default.  Set `Q.longStackSupport`
   to true to enable long stack traces.
 - Long stack traces can now follow the entire asynchronous history of a
   promise, not just a single jump.
 - Introduces `spawn` for an immediately invoked asychronous generator.
   @jlongster
 - Support for *experimental* synonyms `mapply`, `mcall`, `nmapply`,
   `nmcall` for method invocation.

## 0.9.4

 - `isPromise` and `isPromiseAlike` now always returns a boolean
   (even for falsy values). #284 @lfac-pt
 - Support for ES6 Generators in `async` #288 @andywingo
 - Clear duplicate promise rejections from dispatch methods #238 @SLaks
 - Unhandled rejection API #296 @domenic
   `stopUnhandledRejectionTracking`, `getUnhandledReasons`,
   `resetUnhandledRejections`.

## 0.9.3

 - Add the ability to give `Q.timeout`'s errors a custom error message. #270
   @jgrenon
 - Fix Q's call-stack busting behavior in Node.js 0.10, by switching from
   `process.nextTick` to `setImmediate`. #254 #259
 - Fix Q's behavior when used with the Mocha test runner in the browser, since
   Mocha introduces a fake `process` global without a `nextTick` property. #267
 - Fix some, but not all, cases wherein Q would give false positives in its
   unhandled rejection detection (#252). A fix for other cases (#238) is
   hopefully coming soon.
 - Made `Q.promise` throw early if given a non-function.

## 0.9.2

 - Pass through progress notifications when using `timeout`. #229 @omares
 - Pass through progress notifications when using `delay`.
 - Fix `nbind` to actually bind the `thisArg`. #232 @davidpadbury

## 0.9.1

 - Made the AMD detection compatible with the RequireJS optimizer's `namespace`
   option. #225 @terinjokes
 - Fix side effects from `valueOf`, and thus from `isFulfilled`, `isRejected`,
   and `isPending`. #226 @benjamn

## 0.9.0

This release removes many layers of deprecated methods and brings Q closer to
alignment with Mark Miller’s TC39 [strawman][] for concurrency. At the same
time, it fixes many bugs and adds a few features around error handling. Finally,
it comes with an updated and comprehensive [API Reference][].

(*) Use of ``thisp`` is discouraged. For calling methods, use ``post`` or
``invoke``.

### Alignment with the Concurrency Strawman

-   Q now exports a `Q(value)` function, an alias for `resolve`.
    `Q.call`, `Q.apply`, and `Q.bind` were removed to make room for the
    same methods on the function prototype.
-   `invoke` has been aliased to `send` in all its forms.
-   `post` with no method name acts like `fapply`.

### Error Handling

-   Long stack traces can be turned off by setting `Q.stackJumpLimit` to zero.
    In the future, this property will be used to fine tune how many stack jumps
    are retained in long stack traces; for now, anything nonzero is treated as
    one (since Q only tracks one stack jump at the moment, see #144). #168
-   In Node.js, if there are unhandled rejections when the process exits, they
    are output to the console. #115

### Other

-   `delete` and `set` (née `put`) no longer have a fulfillment value.
-   Q promises are no longer frozen, which
    [helps with performance](http://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=1858).
-   `thenReject` is now included, as a counterpart to `thenResolve`.
-   The included browser `nextTick` shim is now faster. #195 @rkatic.

### Bug Fixes

-   Q now works in Internet Explorer 10. #186 @ForbesLindesay
-   `fbind` no longer hard-binds the returned function's `this` to `undefined`.
    #202
-   `Q.reject` no longer leaks memory. #148
-   `npost` with no arguments now works. #207
-   `allResolved` now works with non-Q promises ("thenables"). #179
-   `keys` behavior is now correct even in browsers without native
    `Object.keys`. #192 @rkatic
-   `isRejected` and the `exception` property now work correctly if the
    rejection reason is falsy. #198

### Internals and Advanced

-   The internal interface for a promise now uses
    `dispatchPromise(resolve, op, operands)` instead of `sendPromise(op,
    resolve, ...operands)`, which reduces the cases where Q needs to do
    argument slicing.
-   The internal protocol uses different operands. "put" is now "set".
    "del" is now "delete". "view" and "viewInfo" have been removed.
-   `Q.fulfill` has been added. It is distinct from `Q.resolve` in that
    it does not pass promises through, nor coerces promises from other
    systems. The promise becomes the fulfillment value. This is only
    recommended for use when trying to fulfill a promise with an object that has
    a `then` function that is at the same time not a promise.

## 0.8.12
- Treat foreign promises as unresolved in `Q.isFulfilled`; this lets `Q.all`
  work on arrays containing foreign promises. #154
- Fix minor incompliances with the [Promises/A+ spec][] and [test suite][]. #157
  #158

[Promises/A+ spec]: http://promises-aplus.github.com/promises-spec/
[test suite]: https://github.com/promises-aplus/promises-tests

## 0.8.11

 - Added ``nfcall``, ``nfapply``, and ``nfbind`` as ``thisp``-less versions of
   ``ncall``, ``napply``, and ``nbind``. The latter are now deprecated. #142
 - Long stack traces no longer cause linearly-growing memory usage when chaining
   promises together. #111
 - Inspecting ``error.stack`` in a rejection handler will now give a long stack
   trace. #103
 - Fixed ``Q.timeout`` to clear its timeout handle when the promise is rejected;
   previously, it kept the event loop alive until the timeout period expired.
   #145 @dfilatov
 - Added `q/queue` module, which exports an infinite promise queue
   constructor.

## 0.8.10

 - Added ``done`` as a replacement for ``end``, taking the usual fulfillment,
   rejection, and progress handlers. It's essentially equivalent to
   ``then(f, r, p).end()``.
 - Added ``Q.onerror``, a settable error trap that you can use to get full stack
   traces for uncaught errors. #94
 - Added ``thenResolve`` as a shortcut for returning a constant value once a
   promise is fulfilled. #108 @ForbesLindesay
 - Various tweaks to progress notification, including propagation and
   transformation of progress values and only forwarding a single progress
   object.
 - Renamed ``nend`` to ``nodeify``. It no longer returns an always-fulfilled
   promise when a Node callback is passed.
 - ``deferred.resolve`` and ``deferred.reject`` no longer (sometimes) return
   ``deferred.promise``.
 - Fixed stack traces getting mangled if they hit ``end`` twice. #116 #121 @ef4
 - Fixed ``ninvoke`` and ``npost`` to work on promises for objects with Node
   methods. #134
 - Fixed accidental coercion of objects with nontrivial ``valueOf`` methods,
   like ``Date``s, by the promise's ``valueOf`` method. #135
 - Fixed ``spread`` not calling the passed rejection handler if given a rejected
   promise.

## 0.8.9

 - Added ``nend``
 - Added preliminary progress notification support, via
   ``promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress)``,
   ``promise.progress(onProgress)``, and ``deferred.notify(...progressData)``.
 - Made ``put`` and ``del`` return the object acted upon for easier chaining.
   #84
 - Fixed coercion cycles with cooperating promises. #106

## 0.8.7

 - Support [Montage Require](http://github.com/kriskowal/mr)

## 0.8.6

 - Fixed ``npost`` and ``ninvoke`` to pass the correct ``thisp``. #74
 - Fixed various cases involving unorthodox rejection reasons. #73 #90
   @ef4
 - Fixed double-resolving of misbehaved custom promises. #75
 - Sped up ``Q.all`` for arrays contain already-resolved promises or scalar
   values. @ForbesLindesay
 - Made stack trace filtering work when concatenating assets. #93 @ef4
 - Added warnings for deprecated methods. @ForbesLindesay
 - Added ``.npmignore`` file so that dependent packages get a slimmer
   ``node_modules`` directory.

## 0.8.5

 - Added preliminary support for long traces (@domenic)
 - Added ``fapply``, ``fcall``, ``fbind`` for non-thisp
   promised function calls.
 - Added ``return`` for async generators, where generators
   are implemented.
 - Rejected promises now have an "exception" property.  If an object
   isRejected(object), then object.valueOf().exception will
   be the wrapped error.
 - Added Jasmine specifications
 - Support Internet Explorers 7–9 (with multiple bug fixes @domenic)
 - Support Firefox 12
 - Support Safari 5.1.5
 - Support Chrome 18

## 0.8.4

 - WARNING: ``promise.timeout`` is now rejected with an ``Error`` object
   and the message now includes the duration of the timeout in
   miliseconds.  This doesn't constitute (in my opinion) a
   backward-incompatibility since it is a change of an undocumented and
   unspecified public behavior, but if you happened to depend on the
   exception being a string, you will need to revise your code.
 - Added ``deferred.makeNodeResolver()`` to replace the more cryptic
   ``deferred.node()`` method.
 - Added experimental ``Q.promise(maker(resolve, reject))`` to make a
   promise inside a callback, such that thrown exceptions in the
   callback are converted and the resolver and rejecter are arguments.
   This is a shorthand for making a
